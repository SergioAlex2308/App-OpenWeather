# App-OpenWeather
As part of the challenge in the DOM Manipulation Course on Platzi, this little website was created.

Use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Consult the API to get climate data of the city specified by the user.

API OpenWeather:

Access current weather data for any location on Earth including over 200,000 cities! We collect and process weather data from different sources such as
global and local weather models, satellites, radars and a vast network of weather stations. Data is available in JSON, XML, or HTML format.

[Consult documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api).

Here is the [result](https://sergioalex2308.github.io/App-OpenWeather/), it has been deployed using githubpages.

I created these [mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/6u9vXVGiDL3CCVK7iiLaB2/WeatherApp?node-id=0%3A1&t=pzE9TRr3SGSCK4RM-1) using Figma to give me an idea of the result I should get.
